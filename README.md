# MultibaseCalculator

<h2>CICS 3120 Project One</h2>
This GUI multi-base calculator can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 
with any base between 2 and 16. The slider lets user select the base the calculator is 
currently using. When the user uses the slider to select a different base, the calculator 
responds immediately: the numbers in the calculator's display area will be represented in
the new base, and the digit buttons will reflect the new base.
