# MultibaseCalculator

<h1>CICS 3120 Project One</h1>
This GUI multi-base calculator can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 
with any base between 2 and 16. The slider lets user select the base the calculator is 
currently using. When the user uses the slider to select a different base, the calculator 
responds immediately: the numbers in the calculator's display area will be represented in
the new base, and the digit buttons will reflect the new base.

There are potential bugs in this app. This is the continued develepment for this project.
